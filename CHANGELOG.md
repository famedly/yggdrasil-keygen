### Changes

#### Features

- **add yggdrasil v0.4 support** ([`76a1a3a`])

  This commit stops generating encryption keys and just generates signing
  keys, because yggdrasil v0.4 doesn't use encryption keys anymore.
  Address generation has also been updated.

### Changes

#### Bug Fixes

- **switch secret/public keys** ([`8cdc536`])

  The order of the keys was switched around when generating the output
  file, meaning we ended up with the secret keys in the `_pub`, and the
  public keys in `_sec`. Ooops.


## [0.1.0]
